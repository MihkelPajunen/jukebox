# Jukebox

This application presents a collection of music, where each track links to a dynamic route that contains further information about the specific object, such as the **artist** behind the track, the **title** of the track, as well as the **album** in which the track was initially released. It should, of course, also be possible to play the track in the browser.

## Final implementation

- Present relevant information about each track.
- Allow visitors to download tracks from the site.
- Provide the means to upload a track to the site.

## Personal ambition

My objective is to learn more about dynamic components and state management in Vue, but also how to leverage various APIs to improve the functionality of the application as a whole.
